# EBON
OpenGL Rendering Engine.
A solo project I completed for the Computer Graphics assessment for AIE. 
The goal of the assessment was to implement the loading of OBJ models, their texture mappings and lighting. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this assessment, and spent some time implementing the ImGui library to have real time control over the shaders.
